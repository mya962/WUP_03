## Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
## you choose to sit in??

## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data


## Now add in boxplot
```{r}
boxplot(alcohol~Seat,data=davisdata)
```
 
 The boxes are not disjoint, if we look at the median of the back box it's higher than the other two box's. The front and middle boxes look almost the same.

## Numerical Summarys 
```{r}
favstats(alcohol~Seat,data=ucdavis1)
```

## Inferential Tests

## Conclusions
